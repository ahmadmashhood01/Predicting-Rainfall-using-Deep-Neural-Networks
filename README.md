# Predicting Rainfall Using Deep Neural Networks

This project introduces a deep learning model that
predicts rainfall using a neural network. The model is
trained on a dataset containing historical weather information across different locations in Australia. The dataset is
preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical variables. The features are then scaled and the target variable
is encoded. The model is designed with three hidden layers,
including dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The model
is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy as the loss function. The model demonstrates a
high accuracy in predicting rainfall, with a precision score
of 0.88, recall score of 0.94, and F1 score of 0.91. This
deep learning model has potential applications in water
management and climate change adaptation planning.
